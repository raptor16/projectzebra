The chestnut dying zebras + andrew repository. 

This interfaces the ethernet shield on the arduino to a computer 

Change the socket.py and server.py IP address to that of the arduino wifi shield - which can be found by command line arp -a. 

The current port number is 8000, and can be accessed via localhost:8000

(code is gotten from python - works in python 2.7 
Note that for pyhton 3.0  that SocketServer should be changed to socketserver.
